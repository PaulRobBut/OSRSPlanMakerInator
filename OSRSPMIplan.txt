TODO:

Map-Key system:
	Item/Goal is generated
	Item/Goal map is searched for if they have a match with the name
	if they do, then grab that value
	if not, either:
		if adding: append dictionary with a new KVP, using the Item/Goal's name as they key, the object itself as the value
		if searching: return a "Value not found" message
	//Item/Goal is generated with an initial key of 0
	//(May come back to this, but for now it just seems like the key value just overcomplicates this
	//For now, just make the name the key)
